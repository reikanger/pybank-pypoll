## Credits
Google Gemini helped give me the idea to iterate over the budget_data dictionary in PyBank twice, in order to compare values.

Code snippet in question:
```python
# find the matching dates where greatest increase and greatest decrease occurred
# iterate over budget_data twice to be able to compare against two entries - credit to Google Gemini for the nested for loop idea
for date, pl in budget_data.items():
  for date2, pl2 in budget_data.items():
    if pl - pl2 == greatest_increase:
      greatest_increase_date = date
    if pl - pl2 == greatest_decrease:
      greatest_decrease_date = date
```
